Permissions
###########

A Parkour user can get assigned the following roles:

 * **Active**. Users can create requests and view the status of their own
   requests. The user can attach files to a request. An active user will
   only see the request and the libraries and samples windows populated with
   data from own requests. All additional functions of Parkour are hidden for
   an active user.

 * **Staff**. Users with the staff permission are typically any laboratory
   personal that is involved in request processing. Such users will see the
   complete Parkour software and all submitted requests and can edit requests
   at any time. Staff users can access administrator area to edit shared
   tables. It is possible to control/restrict access to selected parts of the
   administrators area. Note allocate “staff status” to a user select both,
   “activate” and “staff” in the administration site/permissions.

 * **Superuser**. Users with the superuser permission have all the rights of
   staff users, editing rights for all shared tables in the system and the
   rights to add new users. No further restrictions can be set.  Note to
   allocate “superuser status” to a user select all, “activate”, staff” and
   “superuser” in the administration site/permissions.

Adjusting Parkour Content
#########################

To customize Parkour to individual needs a staff user and higher can access the
site administration and edit shared tables. For instance, to add a new library
preparation protocol or edit/delete an existing protocol, go to shared tables
and choose Library Protocols. Choose “Add Library Protocol” to add a new
protocol. Enter information into the requested fields and save the changes. To
edit any other parameter i.e. invoicing, sequencers, index types etc. follow
the same strategy.
