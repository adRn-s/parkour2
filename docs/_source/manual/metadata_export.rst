Metadata Export
===============

To deposit sequences in a public archive (ENA) detailed documentation of the
conducted experiment will be requested. Public repositories provide templates
to standardize documentation and data upload. Parkour LIMS provides a
convenient ENA Export tool that prepares data required for a successful upload
to ENA. The system collects the data related to the experiment and asks the
user to enter the remaining information. The upload is done in multiple steps.
First, Parkour LIMS generates four TSV files, *studies.tsv*, *experiments.tsv*,
*samples.tsv*, and *runs.tsv*. Then, they need to be uploaded to Galaxy, which
will convert these TSV files into XML files accepted by ENA according to ENA
rules. Secondary analysis can be done on metadata utilyzing Galaxy tools and
workflows. Finally, an ENA upload tool in Galaxy will handle the upload.

To start working with the export tool, right-click on a request in the
*Requests* tab and select *ENA Export*. The tool window will be shown where the
user has to fill in general information about the experiment. Galaxy URL and
API key must be specified in order to upload the files directly to Galaxy.
Alternatively, this can be done by downloading the TSV files, previewing and
manually uploading them to Galaxy.

The window's second tab allows the user to enter and edit all sample metadata.
The same editing capabilities, which are implemented across the whole system,
can be used here, i.e., *Apply to All* and *per-cell editing*. Input validation
ensures all the information is present.

When all the required data is provided, the user can either download the TSV
files or push them directly to Galaxy, which will upload the data to ENA.
