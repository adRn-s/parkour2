<p>Dear {{original.pi.full_name}},</p>

<p>{{original.user.full_name}} has submitted a sequencing request (see below for details),
    which needs to be approved before it can be further processed.</p>

<p>There are two ways you can approve the request:
<ul>
    <li>By accessing <a href="{{base_domain}}">your Parkour account</a>,
        right-clicking on the request and selecting 'Approve'.
    </li>
    <li>By visiting <a href="{{approval_url}}">this link</a>.<br>
        <i>N.B.</i>This link is a one-time approval token that can be used by ANY Parkour
        user. For example, should you be unable to approve the request yourself,
        you can forward it to a relevant substitute. This person must also have a 
        Parkour account and be logged in to approve the request.
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
