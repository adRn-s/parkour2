Parkour is a Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) software package
for sample processing and quality management of high-throughput sequencing
(HTS) experiments. It was designed to coordinate laboratory work by clearly
structuring tasks and facilitate high-quality sample preparation. Deep
sequencing users, laboratory personnel, and data managers will benefit from
using Parkour LIMS as a central laboratory and quality management platform:
_quickly jump to that information you need!_ 🤸🏻‍♀️
